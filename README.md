# Prototype for Reading Performance in E-Learning Experiment

This project is part of my undergraduate thesis. The objective of the thesis is to inspect the impact of font size, horizontal text alignment, and contrast polarity to reading comprehension, speed, and likeability. The research compares 2 kinds of each element, 12 vs 14 point font size, left vs justified text alignment, and positive vs negative contrast polarity.

Using this prototype, participant will go through 8 reading sessions with 8 different styles. Each session contains of reading page and question page. The question page will cover comprehension questions and a likert scale. The prototype will measure the reading duration and calculate it into reading speed in WPM. The data of reading speed, comprehension, and likeability will be saved in Web Storage and will be downloaded to local storage as a JSON file.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
